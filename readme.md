A web based .Net application using an MVC design to show data from OpenWeather API 

For a lab assignment in C# Part 2 we were to make a basic MVC application that
accesses the OpenWeather API and then displays some weather information.
I made a few different screens to experiment with the API and the MVC conventions
in VS and .Net Core.

These images show some screens from the running application
